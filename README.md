# Content editing

## Blurbs:

Blurb are a new content type. They can only display 300 characters. Be careful not to use long titles. They are designed to be short updates that link out to other content.

Blurbs will automatically show up on the main United States page. To make them appear on the Project pages, tag them with the relevant project tag in the Tags field.

Note: for the purpose of the United States pages, we aren't using the image field.

## News, Blogs and Publications:

To make these items appear on the relevant pages:

Main United States Page: tag them with "United States" using the Tags field.

Project Pages: tag them with the relevant project using the Tags field.

Publication Image: there is an optional field called "preview image" that can be used to replace the default "cover image" in the Spotlight: Publication section. Optimal image size is 513px wide by 300px tall.

## Staff (Experts):

U.S. Staff will appear on the main United States Experts page without any changes. To add them to a project page, tag them with that project name using the Tags field.

Note: staff need to have United States listed as a "core topic" in addition to being tagged with the project name.

## Project Pages:

When you're ready to add an additional project page, the Digital Team (Wil Thomas or Christian Aldridge) can set it up for you. They will add the project tab to the United States main page and add the project name to the Tags taxonomy.

Once the new taxonomy term has been added to the Tags taxonomy, you can start associating content with it.
